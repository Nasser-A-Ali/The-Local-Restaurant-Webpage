This website was created for a fictional restaurant called The Local Restaurant. It was designed in Figma first and then developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Some of the features of this website include a menu page that pulls items and their details from a JSON file and appends them through DOM manipulation and an order page that uses a form, performs calculations, and returns an order summary.
